# Getting Started

A restaurant review application with a focus on restaurant information (including name, a photograph, address.) as well as ratings. Files containing review information for each restaurant (name of reviewer, 5-star rating and comments). Includes a login and a menu to search the restaurant by name. When viewing a specific restaurant, current reviews are displayed along with a form for the user to submit their own review.
