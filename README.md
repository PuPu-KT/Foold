# A Project4 that's not meant to be..
A restaurant review application built by a single effort & another half-axx last-min change by another often-missing member!
Go further if wanna see this one-liner app.

# About / Tech used
This uses Ruby/Rails only for the project and was built on foundation of another Project i've created earlier called "JAFARR".
(You basically choose a 'restaurant' on landing page(one even not working!) & can review if sign in. Admin someX do not work. 
create/edit restaurant do not work!)  ** BASICALLY, IT AN APP THAT CAN BE SUMMED UP IN 2 OR 3 PICS! **
[I GUESS THIS WILL ENTIRELY BE DELETED ONCE I'VE HV MORE REPOS TO CARE OF...]
